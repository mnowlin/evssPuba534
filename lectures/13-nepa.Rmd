# The NEPA Process 

**Environmental Assessment (EA)** 

The EA is intended to be a concise document that:  
* (1) briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS;

--
* (2) aids an agencyâ€™s compliance with NEPA when no environmental impact statement is necessary; and

--
* (3) facilitates preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement when one is necessary.

---

class: title title-2 

# The NEPA Process 

**Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)** 

* Notice of Intent and Scoping
  * Identify people or organizations who are interested in the proposed action;
	* Identify the significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS; 
	* Determine the roles and responsibilities of lead and cooperating agencies; 
	* Identify gaps in data and informational needs; 
	* Set time limits for the process and page limits for the EIS
