# Environmental Law 

> **The use of public authority to _protect_ the natural environment and human health from the impacts of pollution and development** 

-Salzman and Thompson (2014), pg. 3 

--

- How do know when the natural environment and/or human health needs to be protected?

- What does "protect" mean? How do we know we have achieved adequate protection?

---

class: title title-2 

# Environmental Law 

> **Environmental law regulates human behavior in light of its environmental impacts** 

-Rowell and van Zeben (2021), pg. 3

--

- How do we know when impacts are sufficient to require changes in human behavior?

- How responsive is human behavior to changes in environmental laws?

---

class: title title-2 

# Characteristics of Environmental Law 

--

> **Environmental law is necessarily almost as complex and dynamic as the ecosystem it seeks to protect**

-Lazarus (2004), pg. 6

**Complexity** 

--

* Workings of the ecosystem 

* Highly industrialized economy

???
- Workings of the ecosystem
	- Must account for complex temporal, spatial, geological, chemical, physics, and biological processes
- Highly industrialized economy
	- What is the current and future state of emission reduction technologies

---

class: title title-2 

# Characteristics of Environmental Law 

**Scientific uncertainty** 

--

* The workings of the ecosystem and the _causal mechanisms underlying its transformation_ 

--
* Spatial dimensions

--
* Temporal dimensions

--
* Types, levels, and exposure to contaminants

--
* **Demands of public policy** 

---

class: title title-2 

# Characteristics of Environmental Law 

**Scientific uncertainty** 

> **In many respects scientific uncertainty is _the_ defining feature of environmental policy [law]** 

-Salzman and Thompson (2014), pg. 3 

* Complex interrelations among environmental harms 


???
environmental harms have multiple causes and addressing one may exeterbate another 
---

class: title title-2 

# Characteristics of Environmental Law 

**Scientific uncertainty** 

**Responses to scientific uncertainty**

* Develop better information 

--

* The _precautionary principle_ 
  * Caution in the face of significant but uncertain threats
  * Shifting burden of proof

???
But, we often face trade-offs in risks not risk vs no risk; how well understood and how serious must a problem be before taking action; geo-engeerining and climate change
---

class: title title-2 

# Characteristics of Environmental Law 

**Dynamism** 

--

_Much of environmental law is based on "scientifically informed value judgments"_

* New scientific information

--
* Other changes: Demographic shifts (population changes, age, diets) and technology

--
* Nature changes and ecosystems evolve

---

class: title title-2 

# Characteristics of Environmental Law 

**Precaution** 

--

* Environmental law is focused on prevention rather than redress 

--

**Controversy** 

--
- Distributional conflicts over costs and benefits

--
- Environmental values

---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Market failures** 

--
* **Public goods**: clean air, clean water, ecosystem services 

--
* **Common-pool goods**: the tragedy of the commons 

--
* **Externalities**: costs shifted to the public (e.g., pollution)

--

**Property rights** 

The rights of ownership or control of property including the right to use, transfer ownership, or exclude from use 

---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Mismatched scales** 

* Environmental impacts are often _diffuse_, where the consequences are geographically and spatially distant from the causes 

--

* Mismatched political and natural boundaries 
  * Who should make environmental law, national or local authorities? 

--

* _Race-to-the-bottom_ 

---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Risk** 

Environmental law is about mitigating risk to the environment and human health

--

Risk can be defined as the _exposure to the **chance** of **injury or loss**_ 

--
* **Chance**: risk is probabilistic 

--
* **Injury or loss**

--

**Risk assessment** uses scientific information to estimate harm to the environment and human health from various sources

---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Four principal steps in the risk assessment process**  

--
* _Hazard identification_: Is the item under study (e.g., chemical) causally linked to particular health (or public welfare) effects?   

--

* _Dose-response assessment_: What is the relationship between the magnitude of exposure and the probability that the health (or public welfare) effects will occur?  

???
four steps come from National Research Council: Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process from 1983. Definitions taken from Percival (2013) pg 229
---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Four principal steps in the risk assessment process**  

* _Exposure assessment_: What is the level of exposure of humans (or the environment) to the hazard? 

--

* _Risk characterization_: What is the overall magnitude of the risk? 
  * Combines the first three steps

**Exposure processes**: models of pollution movement through air and water

**Effects processes**: measured through _dose-response functions_ 
]

???
_dose-response functions_ the relationship between exposure to pollution as a cause and specific outcomes as an effect

# Environmental Law 

**Four analytical frameworks** 

* Environmental rights 
* Sustainable development 
* Utilitarianism and cost-benefit analysis 
* Environmental justice 

--

_Which of the four analytical frameworks do you view as most useful for examining environmental law and why_?

# Enforcement 

**How are environmental laws enforced?** 

--

.pull-left[
**Enforcement should achieve**: 
* _Force_ of law: compliance 
* _Rule_ of law: fair application 
]

--

.pull-right[
**Types of violators** 
* _Amoral calculators_ 
* _Political citizens_ 
* _Incompetents_ 
]

--

**Most environmental statutes provide a combination of criminal, civil, and administrative penalties** 

---

class: title title-2 

# Enforcement: The Players 

**Federal, state, and local governments** 
* Degree of centralization
* Assist with compliance vs. sanctions 
* State and local government capture 

--

**Environmental Protection Agency** 
* Refers cases to the DOJ for litigation 
* _Overfiling_ if state response is too slow or too lenient

# Enforcement: The Process 

**Detection** 

* Trade-off between
  * How diligently to monitor 
  * How to punish 

--

**Primary source is _self-reporting_** 
* Paperwork violations are treated the same as physical violations 

---

class: title title-2 

# Enforcement: The Process 


.pull-left[
**Civil enforcement**

* Administrative hearings 
  * https://www.epa.gov/alj 

* Civil litigation 
  * EPA represented by DOJ attorneys

# Enforcement: Citizens Suits 

**Individuals and organizations can bring enforcement actions** 

--

**Can sue:** 
* Any organization alleged to be in violation of environmental law 
* The EPA administrator or other government officials for failing to carry-out a non-discretionary duty

--

**Unless...** 
* It's being "diligently prosecuted" by a federal or state government 

---

class: title title-2 

# Enforcement: Citizens Suits 

**Standing** 

**Must meet four requirements** 

--

* **Injury in fact**: “_an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical_.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560 

--

* Injury can be traced to the challenged action 


---

class: title title-2 

# Enforcement: Citizens Suits 

**Standing** 

**Must meet four requirements** 

* **Redressability**: courts can provide a remedy or redress 

--

* **Zone of Interests**: Injury falls under the interests or concerns in which the law is intended to protect
