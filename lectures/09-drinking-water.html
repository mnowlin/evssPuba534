# Public Water Systems 

&gt; **A water system that provides water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service connections or serves an average of at least 25 people for at least 60 days a year** 

.tiny[-Sham, Chi Ho, and Carolyn Gillette. 2019. _Drinking Water Guide: A Resource for Advocates_. River Network.]

???
“Public” refers to the fact that the water is being consumed by the public, not to the ownership of the water system
--

**80% of water systems are publicly owned and serve about 88% of the U.S. population** 

???
@fuEffectivenessPublicPrivate2020 using a dataset constructed from the [EPA's Safe Drinking Water Information System](https://www.epa.gov/ground-water-and-drinking-water/safe-drinking-water-information-system-sdwis-federal-reporting) found that, "publicly owned PWSs commit significantly more Maximum Contamination Level, Treatment Technique, and Health-Related violations but fewer Monitor and Reporting violations than privately owned PWSs. We also find that municipal-level heterogeneities explain a substantial amount of variation in violation behaviors among PWSs, suggesting water supply quality depends crucially on location-specific regulations and local economic conditions" (from abstract)

# Public Water Systems 

**Drinking water sources**: 
* **Surface water**: lakes, reservoirs, rivers, and streams
  * Approximately two-thirds of the population of the United States receives drinking water that originates from surface water

--

* **Groundwater** 

--

* **Groundwater under the direct influence of surface water (GWUDI)**

???
GWUDI drinking water sources are those that are close enough to a surface water source to be affected by surface water recharge, and they are considered at risk from microbiological contamination

# Public Water Systems 

**Three types of public water systems** 

* **Community Water System (CWS)** 
  * Supplies water to the same population year-round
  * These water systems provide water to more than 299 million people
  * Most serve small populations 
  * 71% rely on ground water, and 29% rely on surface water
  * All federal regulations apply to these systems

# Public Water Systems 

**Three types of public water systems** 

* **Non-Transient Non-Community Water System (NTNCWS)** 
  * Regularly supplies water to at least 25 of the same people at least six months per year
  * Examples: schools, factories, shopping malls, office buildings, and hospitals that have their own water systems
  * Most drinking water regulations apply to these systems

# Public Water Systems 

**Three types of public water systems** 

* **Transient Non-Community Water System (TNCWS)** 
  * Provides water in a place such as a gas station or campground where people do not remain for long periods of time or that may only be operated on a seasonal basis
  * Only regulations for contaminants that pose immediate health risks apply to these systems

# Components of a Drinking Water System 

**Source water** 
???
Source water 

Water treatment 

Water storage 

Water distribution 

--

* Generally surface waters or aquifers (groundwater)

--
* Water systems seek out raw water of the highest quality and of sufficient quantity

--
* _Raw water_: rainwater and water collected directly from lakes, rivers, wells, and springs that has not been treated

--
* Under the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA), each state must conduct source water assessments within source water protection areas for all public water systems under their jurisdiction

---

class: title title-2

# Components of a Drinking Water System 

**Water treatment** 

???
_Surface water sources are vulnerable to microbiological contaminants including bacteria, viruses and parasites
--
* Surface Water Treatment Rules: require water systems to filter and disinfect surface water

--

* _Conventional water treatment_: A combination of mixing, flocculation, sedimentation, filtration and disinfection

--

* _Treatment technologies_: Membrane technologies, Ozone, Ultraviolet light, Ion exchange, Granular activated carbon (GAC)

**Water storage** 

---

class: title title-2

# Components of a Drinking Water System 

**Water distribution** 

* After treatment, potable water is delivered to customers via pipes, with assistance from valves and pumps

--
* Distribution system includes storage facilities (water tanks and storage reservoirs), meters, and fire hydrants

--
* Travels through a series of underground water mains (large diameter pipes) from the water treatment plant to the service area

--
* A service line is a smaller diameter pipe that connects a building’s plumbing system with the water main

  * See: https://www.epa.gov/dwucmr/fourth-unregulated-contaminant-monitoring-rule 

---

class: title title-2

# The Safe Drinking Water Act

**Contaminant selection** 

* **Deciding Whether to Regulate New Contaminants** 
  * The contaminant may have adverse health effects;

  * It is known, or there is a substantial likelihood, that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and

  * Its regulation presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems


???
If EPA can answer “yes” to all three criteria, EPA initiates development of a drinking water regulation.
---

class: title title-2

# The Safe Drinking Water Act

**Standard setting** 

* A nonenforceable maximum contaminant level goal (MCLG) 

???
at a level at which no known or anticipated adverse health effects occur and allows an adequate margin of safety

* Set a maximum contaminant level (MCL): the highest allowable level of that contaminant in drinking water
  * As close to the MCLG as is “feasible” (taking costs into consideration)

# The Safe Drinking Water Act

**Standard setting**

Section 1414 requires that, whenever EPA finds that a public water system in a state with primary enforcement authority does not comply with regulations, the agency must notify the state and the system and provide assistance to bring the system into compliance. If the state fails to commence enforcement action within 30 days after the notification, EPA is authorized to issue an administrative order or commence a civil action. In a nonprimacy state, EPA must notify an elected local official (if any has jurisdiction over the water system) before commencing an enforcement action against the system.
