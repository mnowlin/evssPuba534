# The NEPA Process 

**Threshold questions**: 

* Major federal action? 

* Are the environmental impacts significant?

Based on [Council of Environmental Quality regulations developed in 1978](https://ceq.doe.gov/docs/laws-regulations/FR-1978-11-29-43-FR-55978-CEQ-NEPA-Regulations-NOFR.pdf)

class: title title-2 

# The NEPA Process 

**Major actions** 

* Does this constitute a major action? 

--

* Agencies can't segment or divide up projects 

--

* Also includes private projects that are "entirely or partly financed, assisted, conducted, regulated, or approved by federal agencies"

---

class: title title-2 

# The NEPA Process 

**Major actions** 

CEQ guidelines:
* Adoption of official policy such as rules, regulations, and interpretations

--
* Adoption of formal plans which guide alternative uses of federal resources 

--
* Adoption of programs to implement policy

--
* Approval of specific projects such as construction or management activities located in a defined geographic area  


---

class: title title-2 

# The NEPA Process 

**Significantly affecting the human environment** 
* Does the proposed action significantly impact the environment? 
* Consider "context" and "intensity" 

--

**Categorical exclusions** 
* _A category of actions which do not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment_

# The NEPA Process 

**Environmental Assessment (EA)** 

The EA is intended to be a concise document that:  
* (1) briefly provides sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS;

--
* (2) aids an agencyâ€™s compliance with NEPA when no environmental impact statement is necessary; and

--
* (3) facilitates preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement when one is necessary.

---

class: title title-2 

# The NEPA Process 

**Environmental Impact Statements (EIS)** 

* Notice of Intent and Scoping
  * Identify people or organizations who are interested in the proposed action;
	* Identify the significant issues to be analyzed in the EIS; 
	* Determine the roles and responsibilities of lead and cooperating agencies; 
	* Identify gaps in data and informational needs; 
	* Set time limits for the process and page limits for the EIS
