# What is regulation?

class: title title-2 

# Regulation 

> **Regulation describes the array of public policies explicitly designed to govern economic activity and its consequences at the level of the industry, firm, or individual unit of activity**  

.small[-- Eisner et al., 2018]

--

**Social regulations**: _designed to enforce corporations to accept responsibility for the safety and health of workers and consumers, as well as for the negative by-products of the production process_ 

???
economic regulations

# Regulatory Regimes 

> **A historically specific configuration of policies and institutions which structures the relationships between social interests, the state, and economic actors in multiple sectors of the economy** 

.small[-- Eisner, 2000]

--

_Whenever there is a change in regime, it is possible to identify a unique synthesis of interests, political-economic ideas, and administrative reform doctrines that shape the new regime_

--
* **Political-economy context**: Economic stagflation and growing foreign competition 

--

# Why regulate?

---

class: title title-2 

# Theories of Regulation 

**Public interest theory** 

--

* Regulation is in the public interest, it makes the society better off 

--

* Often in response to _market failures_ 
  * **Externalities** 
  * **Public goods** 
  * **Common-pool goods**
  * Market power 
  * Asymmetric information

# Theories of Regulation 

**Public interest theory** 

* Regulation is in the public interest, it makes the society better off 


**Is there agreement on what is in the public interest?** 

--

_... so much of politics entails people fighting over what the public interest is and trying to realize their own definitions of it_ 

.small[-- Stone, 2012]

---

class: title title-2 

# Theories of Regulation 

**Capture theory** 

--
* Regulation serves private interests 

--
* Transactional: political support from industry in exchange for policies  

--
* "Cognitive capture": accepting the _framing_  of industry interests 

--
* Decline in interest and original constituency over time 

--
* Strong vs weak capture 

--

**When is capture more likely to occur?**  

---

class: title title-2 

# Theories of Regulation 

**Economic theory of regulation** 

--

**Assumes** 
* _Government’s basic resource is the power to coerce_

--
* _An interest group that can convince the government to use its coercive power to the group’s benefit can improve its well-being at the expense of others_

--
* _Agents (firms, individuals, government officials, and interest groups) are rational and try to maximize their own utility (well-being)_ 

---

class: title title-2 

# Theories of Regulation 

**Economic theory of regulation** 

* _... less applicable to the social regulations that have been dominant since the late 1960s_ (Eisner, 2018)

class: title title-2 

# Theories of Regulation 

**Public choice** 

--

* Applies _economic_ assumptions of human behavior to the public sector 
  * Self-interest (utility-maximizers)
  * Not omniscient (boundedly rational)

--

* **Rent seeking** 

--
* Government failures

# Regulatory instruments 

---

class: middle 

## A _regulatory instrument_ is a set of rules or restrictions that govern an activity, including directions on what happens if people undertake too much, or too little of that activity

# Regulatory Instruments 

**Command-and-control** 

--
* _The prohibition or prescription of a specific behavior ... through permits or bans_ 

--

* **Performance** vs **Technology** standards  

--

**Strengths?** 

--

**Weaknesses?** 

---

class: title title-2

# Regulatory Instruments 

**Economic instruments (aka market-based)** 

--

* "Price" behavior to incentivize different behavior  

--

* **Using markets** vs **Creating markets** 

---

class: title title-2

# Regulatory Instruments 

**Using markets** 

.pull-left[
**Externality** 

Social cost $>$ Private cost

Socially efficient outcome = Private cost + **Price** 

**Internalize the externality** 
]

**Common-pool good = no property rights**
* _Individual fishing quota_  markets

**Allowances create de-facto property rights**

**Policy sets the demand curve** 
* Fixed quantity (X*)
  * Cap-and-trade 

* Fixed price (T*)

**Strengths?** 

--

**Weaknesses?** 

---

class: title title-2

# Regulatory Instruments 

**Information-based instruments** 

--

* Provide information to change behavior, such as _labels_ and _disclosures_ 

--

**Strengths?** 

--

**Weaknesses?** 

---

class: title title-2

# Regulatory Instruments 

**Behavioral instruments** 

--

* _Nudges_ ... _default rules_ and _framing_

**Strengths?** 

--

**Weaknesses?** 

---

class: title title-2

# Instrument Choice 

**Constraints** 

* **Institutional and legal**: 
  * separation of power and functions
  * statutory language 

--

* **Practical**: capacity (expertise, budget)

--

* **Path dependency**: past decisions inform current decisions ... _continue existing practices even if better is available_

---

class: title title-2

# Cost-Benefit Analysis 

**Measure the costs and benefits of each possible policy and then choose the policy that is most _efficient_** 

--

**Steps** 
1. Specify set of policy alternatives

--
1. Determine benefits and costs of stakeholders

--
1. Monetize impacts

--
1. Discount to _net present value_ 
  * Time value of money: Future value vs. present value of $100

--
1. Make recommendation
