???
differ from air and water pollution
--

* Many toxins are valuable agricultural, industrial, or consumer products 

--
* We are often not sure what degree of risk a suspected toxin poses 

--
* Safe levels of exposure do not exist 

---

# Toxic Substances 

**Statutes that address toxic substances** 

* **The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976**
* **The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976** 
* **The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980**

# What are some of the challenges associated with regulating toxic substances? 

---

class: title title-2

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Risk** 

Environmental law is about mitigating risk to the environment and human health

--

Risk can be defined as the _exposure to the **chance** of **injury or loss**_ 

--
* **Chance**: risk is probabilistic 

--
* **Injury or loss**

--

**Risk assessment** uses scientific information to estimate harm to the environment and human health from various sources

---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Four principal steps in the risk assessment process**  

--
* _Hazard identification_: Is the item under study (e.g., chemical) causally linked to particular health (or public welfare) effects?   

--

* _Dose-response assessment_: What is the relationship between the magnitude of exposure and the probability that the health (or public welfare) effects will occur?  

???
four steps come from National Research Council: Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process from 1983. Definitions taken from Percival (2013) pg 229

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Four principal steps in the risk assessment process**  

* _Exposure assessment_: What is the level of exposure of humans (or the environment) to the hazard? 

--

* _Risk characterization_: What is the overall magnitude of the risk? 
  * Combines the first three steps

# Toxic Substances 


**Tolerable risk** 

???
if 2 out of a million exposed get cancer, should we regulate the substance? 
--

_What risk is acceptable and who should decide?_ 

--

* The acceptability of risk involves probability and severity

--
* Voluntary risks are viewed differently than imposed risks 

--
* _Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute_ (1980)
  * OHSA only requires a "safe" workplace not a "risk free" workplace 

--
* _Let's apply our four frameworks to the question of tolerable risk_ 

???
environmental rights; sustainable development; cost-benefit analysis; environmental justice

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Scientific uncertainty** 

--

Risk $\neq$ Uncertainty

--

**Lack of information** 

* The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
  * Requires extensive toxicology tests of _carcinogenic_ risks 

* **The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)**

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**How is cancer risk determined?** 

--
* Epidemiological study

???
wait to see if an exposed population develops cancers 
--
* Animal bioassay 

--

**Regulating under uncertainty** 
* Burden of proof 
* Degree of certainty 
* _Precautionary principle_ 

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory options** 

* Ban or limit production OR attempt to control exposure 

--

* Appropriate regulatory standard 
  * Health based 
  * Feasibility 
  * Risk-benefit 
  * _Informational approach_ 

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory standard examples** 

**Health based** 
* The _Delaney Clauses_ in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
  * Food or color additives are treated as "unsafe" if "found ... to induce cancer in man or animal" 

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory standard examples** 

**Feasibility** 
* The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
  * Ensure a "safe" work place but only "to the extent _feasible_" 
  * Courts have concluded that standards must be both technically and economically feasible 

--
* Safe Drinking Water Act 
  * As close to the MCLG as is feasible 

???
MCLG: maximum contaminant level goal

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory standard examples** 

**Risk-benefit** 
* The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
  * Manufacturer must register with EPA

    * will not pose an "unreasonable risk to man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, and environmental costs and benefits of the pesticide" 
    
???
when "used in accordance with widespread and commonly recognized practice"
