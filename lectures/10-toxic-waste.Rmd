???
differ from air and water pollution
--

* Many toxins are valuable agricultural, industrial, or consumer products 

--
* We are often not sure what degree of risk a suspected toxin poses 

--
* Safe levels of exposure may not exist

# Toxic Substances 

**Statutes that address toxic substances** 

* **The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976**
* **The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) of 1976** 
* **The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) of 1980**

# What are some of the challenges associated with regulating toxic substances? 

---

class: title title-2

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Risk** 

Environmental law is about mitigating risk to the environment and human health

--

Risk can be defined as the _exposure to the **chance** of **injury or loss**_ 

--
* **Chance**: risk is probabilistic 

--
* **Injury or loss**

--

**Risk assessment** uses scientific information to estimate harm to the environment and human health from various sources

---

class: title title-2 

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Four principal steps in the risk assessment process**  

--
* _Hazard identification_: Is the item under study (e.g., chemical) causally linked to particular health (or public welfare) effects?   

--

* _Dose-response assessment_: What is the relationship between the magnitude of exposure and the probability that the health (or public welfare) effects will occur?  

???
four steps come from National Research Council: Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process from 1983. Definitions taken from Percival (2013) pg 229

# Themes of Environmental Law 

**Four principal steps in the risk assessment process**  

* _Exposure assessment_: What is the level of exposure of humans (or the environment) to the hazard? 

--

* _Risk characterization_: What is the overall magnitude of the risk? 
  * Combines the first three steps

# Toxic Substances 


**Tolerable risk** 

???
if 2 out of a million exposed get cancer, should we regulate the substance? 
--

_What risk is acceptable and who should decide?_ 

--

* The acceptability of risk involves probability and severity

--
* Voluntary risks are viewed differently than imposed risks 

--
* _Industrial Union Department v. American Petroleum Institute_ (1980)
  * OHSA only requires a "safe" workplace not a "risk free" workplace 

--
* _Let's apply our four frameworks to the question of tolerable risk_ 

???
environmental rights; sustainable development; cost-benefit analysis; environmental justice

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Scientific uncertainty** 

--

Risk $\neq$ Uncertainty

--

**Lack of information** 

* The Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)
  * Requires extensive toxicology tests of _carcinogenic_ risks 

* **The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA)**

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**How is cancer risk determined?** 

--
* Epidemiological study

???
wait to see if an exposed population develops cancers 
--
* Animal bioassay 

--

**Regulating under uncertainty** 
* Burden of proof 
* Degree of certainty 
* _Precautionary principle_

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory standard examples** 

**Health based** 
* The _Delaney Clauses_ in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act 
  * Food or color additives are treated as "unsafe" if "found ... to induce cancer in man or animal" 

---

class: title title-2

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory standard examples** 

**Feasibility** 
* The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA)
  * Ensure a "safe" work place but only "to the extent _feasible_"

--
* Safe Drinking Water Act 
  * As close to the MCLG as is feasible 

???
MCLG: maximum contaminant level goal

# Toxic Substances 

**Regulatory standard examples** 

**Risk-benefit**
