# Air Pollution 

> **Air pollution is a mix of particles and gases that can reach harmful concentrations both outside and indoors. Its effects can range from higher disease risks to rising temperatures. Soot, smoke, mold, pollen, methane, and carbon dioxide are a just few examples of common pollutants.**

# Air Pollution 

> **Decades of research across multiple disciplines have revealed significant associations between exposure to ambient air pollution and negative human health effects, including respiratory ailments, cardiovascular disease and premature death.** 

.small[-- Boyd 2019, pgs. 18-19]

???
**Ambient air is atmospheric air in its natural state**. It is what we breathe when the atmosphere is not contaminated by airborne pollutants. The composition of ambient air varies depending on the elevation above sea level as well as human factors such as the level of pollution.

# The Clean Air Act: Sections 

**Section 108: Air quality criteria and control techniques**

* Requires EPA to identify air pollutants that may "_reasonably be anticipated to **endanger** public health or welfare_" 

--
* From either _stationary_ or _mobile_ sources

--
* Issue air quality criteria that: _shall accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air, in varying quantities_

---

class: title title-2

# The Clean Air Act: Sections 

**Section 109: National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS)**

The EPA must establish NAAQS for air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare ... and whose presence in ambient air results from numerous or diverse sources 

--

* _Primary_ standards: protect human health 
* _Secondary_ standards: includes animals, wildlife, water, and visibility 
* **Standards are uniform and based on health considerations**  

---

class: title title-2

# The Clean Air Act: NAAQS 

**Six criteria air pollutants** 
* Sulfur dioxide (SO2) **2010**
* Particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10) **2013**
* Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) **2010**
* Carbon monoxide (CO) **2011**
* Ozone **2015**

# The Clean Air Act: Sections 

**Section 110: State Implementation Plans** 

EPA sets NAAQS standards, but the states are responsible for establishing procedures to attain and maintain the standards 

--

Requires states to develop and submit to EPA for approval _state implementation plans_ (SIPs) specifying measures to assure that air quality within each state meets the NAAQS 
* An example of _cooperative federalism_

* _Offsets_

???
**Offsets**: _Creates a bubble over an air quality region. A new or modified source may not pollute unless it offsets its emissions by reductions from existing sources in the region._

???
_Independent scientific review has played a fundamental role in the NAAQS program, bolstering EPA’s own scientific efforts and helping to maintain the credibility of the program. This has contributed significantly to the political durability of the NAAQS. As noted earlier, Congress was an important early driver in this respect, instructing EPA in the 1977 amendments to create an independent Clean Air Science Advisory Committee (CASAC) that would play a formal role in the NAAQS review and revision process_
