# Cost-Benefit Analysis 

**Major steps** 

1. Specify the set of alternatives
1. Catalog the costs and benefits and select measurement indicators
1. Monetize all costs and benefits
1. Discount benefits and costs to obtain _net present values_
1. Compute the net present value of each alternative
1. Based on net present values determine the most efficient alternative

# Cost-Benefit Analysis 

**How are benefits measured?** 

**Willingness-to-pay**

_A way to determine a person's value for a particular good; what they would willingly give up in exchange_ 

--
* Travel-cost method
* Hedonic price method 
* Contingent valuation

**Value of a Statistical Life**

class: title title-2 

# Value of a Statistical Life

**Estimates of how much people are willing to pay for small reductions in their risks of dying from adverse health conditions that may be caused by environmental pollution**

_Environmental Protection Agency_

**EPA value: $10 million**

--

**Value of Mortality Risk Reduction**: _reported in units such as dollars per micro-risk per person per year, where a “micro-risk” represents a one in a million chance of dying_

* Markets don't _fail_, rather markets are _missing_
  * Government policy should address property rights and lessen transaction costs

# CAA: Market-Based Instruments 

**Sulfur dioxide allowance trading** 

**Reasons for success**
* Lower than expected cost with switching to low-sulfur coal 
* Lower costs of scrubbing SO2 
* Banking allowances lead to over compliance during phase 1 
* Technological improvements (scrubbers above regulatory standards)
* Efficient allowance trading market 

---

class: title title-2

# CAA: Market-Based Instruments 

**Sulfur dioxide allowance trading** 

**Falling apart** 

* 2005 the EPA promulgated the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR) 

--

* 2011 EPA promulgated the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR)
  * The value of allowances dropped 
  
---

class: title title-2

# CAA: Market-Based Instruments 

**Nitrogen oxide interstate emission program** 

--

* Existed from 2003-2008 

* **1977 Amendment**: Section 110 and interstate air pollution 

* **1990 Amendment**: Congress created the Ozone Transport Commission (OTC)

# CAA: Market-Based Instruments 

**Conclusions** 
* Market-based approaches can improve environmental quality by providing economic incentives to reduce pollution 

* Policymakers must design, monitor, and enforce market rules 

* Volatility in cap-and-trade markets occur when allowances fall below expected value 

* Adaptability through periodic updating and revision in response to new scientific information
