# Key (federal, state, and local) actors

---

class: title title-2

# Federalism 

**Mismatched scales** 

* Environmental impacts are often _diffuse_, where the consequences are geographically and spatially distant from the causes 

* Mismatched political and natural boundaries 
  * Who should make environmental law, national or local authorities? 

---

class: title title-2

# Federalism 

**Jurisdiction** 
* _Exclusive_
* _Concurrent_ 

--

**Preemption**: 
* _The higher authority of law displaces the lower authority of law_  

--
* **Supremacy Clause**

---

class: title title-2

# Federal Government 

**Enumerated Powers** 
* Powers granted to the federal government in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution

# Indigenous Peoples 

**Tribal governments** 
* Distinct political bodies

**Enforcement of environmental laws on tribal lands**

.small[
_We analyze enforcement of and compliance with the Clean Water Act (CWA) and Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to compare the implementation of environmental policy on tribal lands with nontribal facilities. **Analysis reveals that, compared with nontribal facilities, tribal facilities experience less rigorous CWA and SDWA enforcement and are more likely to violate these laws**._]

# Sources of environmental law 

---

> **Environmental law, as now defined, is primarily a synthesis of
pre-environmental era common law rules, principles from other
areas of law, and post-environmental era statutes which are lightly
influenced by the application of concepts derived from ecology and
other areas of science, economics, and ethics.**
