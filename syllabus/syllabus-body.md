# COVID-19

The COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. **The College of Charleston requires that masks be worn while indoors and you must wear a mask at all times while in class.** Although vaccinations are currently not required, _I ask you to be respectful of the health and safety of others_. If you have not received the **COVID-19 vaccine (as well as the booster), which is safe, free, and effective, please consider doing so immediately**. Information about the vaccine is available from the [SCDHEC website](https://scdhec.gov/covid19/covid-19-vaccine) and information about where and when to obtain a vaccine is also available on the SCDHEC website [vaccine locator page](https://vaxlocator.dhec.sc.gov/).    


# Course Description

Environmental law in the United States is a complex thicket of legislation, agency regulations, and court decisions that shapes how the US approaches environmental issues. This course will provide an overview of several major topics within environmental law as well as the regulatory instruments used to address environmental problems.  The aim of this course is for students in the MES, MPA, or concurrent MES/MPA programs to gain an understanding of the development and scope of environmental law in the US. 


\vspace{0.1in}
\noindent The course is divided into four sections, 1) **Foundations**: includes some of the foundational aspects of environmental law including environmental risks, enforcement, key actors, sources of environmental laws, administrative law, and rulemaking; 2) **Pollution**: covers legal and regulatory approaches for air pollution, climate change, water pollution, drinking water, toxic substances, and waste management; 3) **Ecosystem Services**: discusses management of natural resources and includes the public trust doctrine, wetlands, land use, biodiversity, and endangered species; and 4) **Environmental Impact Statements**: examines the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

\noindent Laptops are allowed, but should only be used to access the readings and for in-class group assignments. Phones should be put away during class.  _I encourage you to take notes by hand, with pen and paper_. [You learn better that way](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/27/learning/should-teachers-and-professors-ban-student-use-of-laptops-in-class.html). I recommend taking notes using the [Cornell Method](http://www.usu.edu/arc/idea_sheets/pdf/note_taking_cornell.pdf).  

## NASPAA Competencies and Course Learning Objectives 

Students who graduate from NASPAA accredited MPA programs should develop the ability to: lead and manage in public governance, participate in and contribute to the policy process, apply skills in analysis and critical thinking to solve problems and make decisions, articulate and apply a public service perspective, and communicate and interact productively with a diverse and changing workforce and citizenry. **This course is designed with a special emphasis on applying skills in analysis and critical thinking to solve problems and make decisions**. To that end, learning objectives include:

-  Develop an understanding of key environmental statues 

-  Evaluate the various regulatory instruments used to address environmental problems

-  Analyze a specific environmental problem and the legal and regulatory approaches used to address it

-  Display oral, written, and group communication skills


\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent These objectives will be achieved through critically reading the course readings; by writing several short reflection papers; and by completing a paper about a specific environmental regulation.

# Required Readings 

There are no required books to purchase. All the readings will be made available on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu) for each week. Readings should be read prior to class and you should come to class prepared to discuss the readings.  

## Attendance Policy 

Attendance will be taken for each class session, and will be part of your course engagement grade. You are allowed to miss _one class without penalty_.  **However, do not come to class if you feel ill. Additionally, if you have been exposed to or tested positive for COVID-19, do not come to class regardless of how you feel. In those cases, I am happy to meet with you on Zoom to discuss material you missed and wave the attendance requirement. Just let me know.**

## Assignments 

**Specific instructions for the following assignments are posted on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu/d2l/home). All work must be turned in through the Assignment folder on OAKS, and is due at class time: Thursday, 5:30 PM Eastern**.

* _Reflection Papers_: You will write 10 short, about 2-3 pages, reflection papers that summarize and integrate the readings. Prompts will be given for each paper in [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). Note that 12 are assigned, but only 10 will be graded. **When assigned, reflection papers are due at class time.** 

* _Paper_: You will write a 10-12 page paper that covers a major state or federal environmental regulation. In the paper you will describe the regulation, discuss the environmental problem it is meant to address, discuss the legislative authority for the regulation, and court decisions that are relevant to the regulation. **The paper is due on the last day of classes, April 21, at class time.**   


<!-- * _Issue papers_: You will pick a public policy issue or problem of interest to you and write a series of five short, 2 to 3 page, papers about different aspects of the issue. -->

<!-- * _Policy process papers_: -->
<!-- * _Agency paper_: You will write a short, 3 to 4 page, agency paper that discusses a government (federal, state, or local) or non-profit agency involved in implementing some policy or policies related to your issue. -->

<!-- * _Presentation_: You will give a short, five-minute maximum, presentation on the policy issue you have been researching all semester. The presentations will be given on **Dec 2 and during the final exam time on Dec 9**, and you will be randomly assigned to one of those dates.  -->

In that case, I will make arraignments with you to make-up the in-class assignment.** 

* _Course Engagement_: Students are expected to participate in the course by asking questions, providing thoughtful comments, and through making contributions to the group discussion portion of class. **Class discussion should be better than it would have been had you not attended.** Note that the professor has final say over what does or does not count as adequate participation.

### A Note on Feedback 

Each of your reflection papers will be graded in a holistic fashion. I will examine and grade the document as whole, I am therefore not likely to make specific comments on multiple aspects of each of your papers. Any feedback will be provided on [OAKS](https://lms.cofc.edu). If you adequately address what is asked for in each of the papers, you will likely get all of most of the points. Any major issues with the assignments or your writing in general (such as grammar) that results in a significant loss of points (below 90%) will be addressed with feedback. Finally, I am happy to meet you with to discuss any individual paper or your writing as a whole.         

## Late Work Policy 

Late work is subject to a 48-hour grace period, and after that will be penalized 10% each day (24 hr period) it is late, up to 3 days. After 5 days beyond the due date the assignment will not be accepted unless you have contacted me to let me know you need more time. For example, if an assignment is due Thursday at 5:30 PM, the grace period ends on Saturday at 5:30 PM and it is late as of 5:31 PM and you lose 10%. After Sunday at 5:31 PM you lose another 10%, after Monday at 5:31 PM another 10%, and no work will be accepted after Tuesday at 5:30 PM. 

<!-- Attendance is expected and mandatory for this course. Attendance will be taken at each session through a short writing exercise at the end of each course. You are allowed to miss one class without penalty. You will lose 20 points for each absences after the first. **Attendance will be taken through short one-paragraph reflections on what you learned during that class period. You will turn in your reflection at the end of class in OAKS**.  -->
